# Credit_Risk_Analysis


## Overview of the loan prediction risk analysis:

I was asked to use imbalanced-learn and scikit-learn libraries to build and evaluate models using resampling. Using the credit card credit dataset from LendingClub, a peer-to-peer lending services company, I was to oversample the data using the RandomOverSampler and SMOTE algorithms, and undersample the data using the ClusterCentroids algorithm. Then, use a combinatorial approach of over- and undersampling using the SMOTEENN algorithm. Next, I was asked to compare two new machine learning models that reduce bias, BalancedRandomForestClassifier and EasyEnsembleClassifier, to predict credit risk.

## Results:

- <B> Naive Random Oversampling</B>

- <B> SMOTE Oversampling</B>
- <B> Undersampling</B>
- <B> Combination (Over and Under) Sampling</B>
- <B> Balanced Random Forest Classifier</B>
- <B> Easy Ensemble AdaBoost Classifier</B>

There is a bulleted list that describes the balanced accuracy score and the precision and recall scores of all six machine learning models (15 pt)

There is a summary of the results (2 pt)
There is a recommendation on which model to use, or there is no recommendation with a justification (3 pt)
